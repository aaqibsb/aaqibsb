I'm an aspiring robotics engineer with a background in mechatronics and automation. Being an enthusiast for digital crafting, I joined the University of Maryland as a graduate student that allowed me to get my hands dirty in robotics software. All the coding projects are built from scratch and follows the programming paradigms. I am also passionate about FPV drones and love building them :).

Currently seeking opportunites for Summer and Fall 2023!
